Hi :wave:, I'm Nebojsa, primarily a Software Developer, partly a DevOps, occasionally a System Architect, but currently an Engineering Manager at Happiest Baby.

I love building scalable systems in the :cloud:, designing them from the ground :arrow_up: and optimizing their performance and execution :stopwatch:.
